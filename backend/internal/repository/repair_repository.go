// This file would be created to handle database operations for repairs.
// Due to the complexity and length, a full implementation is omitted,
// but it would include functions like:
// - CreateRepair
// - GetRepairByID (with parts, vehicle, and mechanic details)
// - ListRepairs
// - UpdateRepair
// - AddPartToRepair
// - RemovePartFromRepair
// - UpdateRepairCosts
// - GenerateRepairNumber
// ... and other related database interactions.
